# Homework 3 README file for Interpolation and Integration

**List of files:**
hw3-Chaturvedi.py
cubicSpline.jpg
LagrangeInterpolation.jpg
stepError.jpg
stepValue.jpg
hw3-Chaturvedi.pdf

**Instructions**
This program is written,**using my own code**, in python 3.10, and is in 
the form ofa python script. To run this file the user must go to their 
terminal, change their working directory into the folder containing this 
file, and then run the following command:

python hw3-Chaturvedi.py
 **or**
python3 hw3-Chaturvedi.py

Upon doing this, the script will run, and will produce four .jpg files, 
titled cubicSpline.jpg, LagrangeInterpolation.jpg, stepErrorPlot.jpg and 
stepValuePlot.jpg. These file contain the plots for the cubic 
spline interpolation, the Lagrangian interpolation, the integration 
errors as a function of steps and the integral values as a function of the 
steps.
