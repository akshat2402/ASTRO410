**Instructions**
This program is written, **using my own code**, in python 3.10, and is in the form of a Jupyter 
Notebook (.ipynb). To run this file, the user must first open a jupyter 
session on their terminal and then open the file titled 
hw1-Chaturvedi.ipynb. Once the user has opened the notebook, there are 
further instructions in the notebook itself to use the contained 
functions. The only inputs the user has to provide inside the notebook to 
calculate the Lagrange points of a two body system with the bodies having 
masses M1 and M2, are the masses and the x and y coordinate where they 
wish to find the potential, acceleration in the x and acceleration in the 
y. The notebook will also output plots with contours showing the 
potentials and vectors showing the acceleration at points they provide. 
The program will also output two .dat files containing the grid data as 
well as the 5 Lagrange points.
