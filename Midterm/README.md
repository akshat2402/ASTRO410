**Prerequisites**
The python package tqdm must be installed to run this program (for the progress bar). This can be done using the terminal, via the command 
pip install tqdm

**Instructions**
This program is written, **using my own code**, in python 3.10, and is in 
the form of a python script. To run this file, the user must go to their 
terminal, change their working directory into the folder containing this 
file, and then run the following command:

python midterm-Chaturvedi.py
**or**
python3 midterm-Chaturvedi.py

Upon doing this, the script will run, with a progress bar visible to 
enable the user to see the wait period, and will produce 4 .jpg files, 
which are listed at the start of this README file.
